# secret_presence_detector

The project involves building a system with two Arduinos for presence detection and keyword-triggered audio recording. Each Arduino uses an onboard camera or motion sensor to detect presence and a microphone to listen for a specific keyword. Both detection and keyword recognition should run locally on the device, while the recorded audio is sent to a laptop for further processing, such as transcription or comparison between the two devices.

The project may include:

Creating datasets for presence detection and keyword recognition

Documenting the process on GitHub

Using tools like Weights & Biases for tracking

Optional: experimenting with federated learning between the two devices

The initial focus is on building the basic detection and recording system before attempting advanced features like federated learning.
